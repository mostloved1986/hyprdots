# Note that sourcing is kinda new, so the order shouldn't be changed, it can lead to "errors"
# if this happens to you there are two things you can do, the first one being the simplest, stick to the given order
# second one being very annoying, comment every empty line in the configs or better have none
# don't know why a different order leads to empty lines being an invalid config line
